# Frontend Mentor - Galleria slideshow site solution

![](./preview.jpg)
(this is what the result should look like)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox

It's a multipage website where every art work is link to an individual page where we can check the different details of the masterpiece and author autoportrait
